          As we delve into the realm of web development, one of the most significant
          applications we encounter is the use of asynchronous programming to interact
          with APIs through HTTP requests. This is where the true power of
          <code>Promises</code> and <code>async/await</code> shines. But first, we need to
          understand what API and HTTPS requests are.
        </p>

          <summary>What is an API?</summary>

              Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs made available in
              programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality
              more easily. They abstract more complex code away from you, providing some
              easier syntax to use in its place.
              <br />
              <br />
              As a real-world example, think about the electricity supply in your house,
              apartment, or other dwellings. If you want to use an appliance in your
              house, you plug it into a plug socket and it works. You don't try to wire it
              directly into the power supply — to do so would be really inefficient and,
              if you are not an electrician, difficult and dangerous to attempt.

          Basically, <code>API</code> is a tool, an abstraction to help you do what you
          want more easily. Think of it as a complex function that you can just call and
          use without having to know how it actually works under the hood. <br /><br />
          Take Photoshop as an example. With Photoshop, if you want to blur an image, you
          can just use the blur tool. Without Photoshop, you would have to learn the
          algorithm of image blurring, then write the program for it. <br />
          In the same way, <code>API</code> is a tool for developers. Every time
          developers write a new program, they don't have to start from scratch to build
          an application that tries to do everything. Instead, they can contract out
          certain responsibilities by using existing <code>APIs</code> that do the job
          better.
        </p>

        <h3>What can APIs do?</h3>
        <p>
          Ever wonder how when you ask Alexa to play a song on Spotify, it works? Or how
          when you search for all nearby stores on a shopping website, it shows you a list
          of stores pinned on a Google Map ? How did they do that ? Did they hire Google
          to help create their map?
        </p>

          No, they probably don't, that is actually all thanks to <code>APIs</code>.
          <br />
          <code>APIs</code> are everywhere you look - and you might not even realize it.
          There is an API for just about anything we can think of: from the Weather to
          Maps, Authentication, Bluetooth, Stock Prices, Cat Images, Pokemon database,
          useless but true facts, Anime quotes, etc... Some of them are free, without
          needing any API keys (<a href="https://thecatapi.com/">the Cat API</a>), most
          are free but requires API keys (<a href="https://openweathermap.org/api"
            >OpenWeather API</a
          >), and some are paid (<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps"
            >Google Maps API</a
          >,
          <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction">
            ChatGPT API</a
          >).
        </p>

        <p>
          There are a few ways to access the functionality provided by third party
          <code>APIs</code>, but for this article we'll focus on making an
          <code>HTTP</code> request to a specific <code>URL</code> pattern to retrieve
          data.

        <h2>HTTP</h2>
        <details>
          <summary>What is protocol?</summary>
          <p>
            The language used to ask for data to get sent—in either direction—is called
            the protocol. The protocol describes exactly how to ask the server for data,
            or to tell the server that there is data coming.
          </p>
        </details>
        <p>
          <code>HTTP</code> stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is a
          request-response protocol — this means that the client sends a request to the
          server, and the server sends a response back to the client.
        </p>
        <h3>HTTP Messages</h3>
        <p>
          There are two types of HTTP messages, requests and responses, each with its own
          format.
        </p>
        <h4>Request</h4>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
          GET /v1/images/search HTTP/1.1
          Host: api.thecatapi.com
          Authorization: Basic YWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1l
        </code></pre>
        <p>Requests consist of the following elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An HTTP method that defines the operation the client wants to perform.
            Typically, a client wants to fetch a resource (using <code>GET</code>) or post
            the value of an HTML form (using <code>POST</code>). Full list of HTTP methods
            can be found
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods">here</a>.
          </li>
          <li>The path of the resource to fetch (<code>/v1/images/search</code>).</li>
          <li>The version of the HTTP protocol. (<code>HTTP/1.1</code>)</li>
          <li>
            Optional headers that convey additional information for the servers (
            <code>Host</code> and <code>Authorization</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            A body, for some methods like <code>POST</code>, similar to those in
            responses, which contain the resource sent. This is optional, as
            <code>GET</code> requests usually don't need a body.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Response</h4>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
          HTTP/1.1 200 OK
          content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
          Content-Length: 90

          [{"id":"bvg","url":"https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/bvg.jpg",
          "width":1024,"height":768}]
        </code></pre>
        <p>Responses consist of the following elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The version of the HTTP protocol they follow(<code>HTTP/1.1</code>).</li>
          <li>
            A status code and message, indicating if the request was successful or not,
            and why (<code>200 OK</code>). A common example is the infamous
            <code>404 Not Found</code> status code. For a full list of status codes and
            their meaning, click
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status">here</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            HTTP headers, like those for requests (e.g: <code>Content-Length</code> and
            <code>content-type</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            Optionally, a body containing the fetched resource.
            (<code>[{"id":"bvg"..."height":768}]</code>)
          </li>
        </ul>

        In the next page, you will see this all in action with the <code>fetch()</code> API.
