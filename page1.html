      <h1>Understanding Asynchronous Operations in JavaScript</h1>
      <p>
        Asynchronous programming is used for handling API requests, file reading, and other long processes. This page explains what
        they are, why they're important, and how they're different from synchronous code.
      </p>
      <h2>What is Asynchronous Programming?</h2>
      <p>
        Asynchronous programming allows a program to start a long-running task, like fetching data from
        a server while running other code at the same without it becoming blocked. This is important in JavaScript for making sure the code runs correctly and does create a race condition.
      </p>
      <h2>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Code</h2>
      <p>
        In synchronous programming, code is run one after another,
        meaning each task must finish before the next one starts. This can
        lead to problems, especially when dealing with operations that
        take a significant amount of time. Asynchronous programming overcomes
        this by allowing tasks to be performed concurrently, improving
        responsiveness and efficiency.
      </p>
      <h2>Asynchronous Patterns in JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript has many ways to handle asynchronous operations. One
        of the simplest is the <code>setTimeout</code> function.
      </p>
      <h3>Example: Using <code>setTimeout</code></h3>
      <pre>
            <code>
        // Example of setTimeout
        console.log('Start');
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log('This is an asynchronous message');
        }, 2000);
        console.log('End');
            </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        In this example, <code>setTimeout</code> is used to delay a function's
        execution. The console will first log 'Start' and 'End', and after 2
        seconds, it will log the asynchronous message, demonstrating the
        non-blocking nature of asynchronous code.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the following page we will look into promises and async/await which are the most common ways to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript.
